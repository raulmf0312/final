Description

Project: MVP for Kickstarter-like platform focused on Real Estate investment opportunities. Create a simple site that lists properties that users could potentially invest in. Each list listing can be clicked into for additional information.

Scope: MVP that enables users to login and see current listings from landlords (also called funraisers) raising funds; further, the user can see the details of the property, the amount the landlord wants to raise, investment details, and learn about the landlord. Users interested in becoming a new landlord or simply wanting to raise cash can also create new listings that will consequently be displayed for others to see. Finally, users can review existing landlords. The process of user funding and managing an existing investment was deemed out of scope for this particular project as well as for the content of the class and would be developed at a later stage only.
